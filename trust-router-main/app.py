"""
Ask a research question, watch the agents work, see what to believe.

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... python3 app.py      then http://localhost:8800

You type a question. Three agents work on it, each given different material so
they fail in different ways:

  Data analyst   Proposes specific findings the question implies, from what it
                 knows. Each one is written as a claim you could check.
  Librarian      Searches published papers for real passages about the question
                 and writes a cited answer. This reuses Quorum's literature
                 code: Europe PMC search, full text from PubMed Central, and
                 passage ranking.
  Critic         Reads each claim with the paper passages beside it and says
                 whether the evidence actually supports it. Never sees who
                 wrote the claim.

Then plain code sorts each claim into act on it, check first, or set aside.
No model assigns a tier; a referee can lower trust but never raise it.

Everything streams to the page as it happens.
